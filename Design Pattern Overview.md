### Model 
The data we have in our applicaion

### View 
The user interface the one the user gets to interacr with 

### Controller 
This is the middle man or the orchestrator that communicates between the model and the view

## What are the cons of MVC 
- A common pitfall is putting too much code in the controller creating a bottle neck and makes them hard to test
- Not as flexible as MVVM
